# The algorithm is as follows

Input: Breed, age, weight, and health status of a cow/bull
Output: The calculated price of the cow/bull

1. Define the prices for different categories of cattle based on the following factors:
   - Breed (e.g., Holstein, Angus, Brahman, etc.)
   - Age (e.g., calf, yearling, adult)
   - Weight (e.g., lightweight, mediumweight, heavyweight)
   - Health status (e.g., healthy, sick, injured)

2. Collect information on the particular cow/bull that you want to price, such as its breed, age, weight, and health status. Store this information in appropriate variables.

3. Determine the category of cattle that the cow/bull belongs to based on the information collected in the previous step. 
   - Category A: Holstein, adult, lightweight, healthy
   - Category B: Angus, adult or yearling, mediumweight, healthy
   - Category C: Brahman, yearling or adult, heavyweight, healthy
   - Category D: Any breed, any age, any weight, sick or injured

4. Use the appropriate pricing formula to calculate the price of the cow/bull based on its category:
   - Category A:  (weight in pounds) x (breed coefficient) x 1.5 + (age coefficient) x 50
   - Category B:  (weight in pounds) x (breed coefficient) x 1.2 + (age coefficient) x 70
   - Category C:  (weight in pounds) x (breed coefficient) x 1.1 + (age coefficient) x 100
   - Category D:  (weight in pounds) x (breed coefficient) x 0.5

   Note: The breed coefficient set a price range specific to the racial characteristics of the breed. The age coefficient accounts for the depreciation over the time.

5. Return the calculated price of the cow/bull as the output of the algorithm.


#### The actual pricing formula, pricing range, and categorization should be adjusted based on the specifics of the cattle market where this algorithm will be used.
